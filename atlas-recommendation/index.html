      One of the first design tasks I was assigned for the Atlas design team was
      to design a breadcrumb component. The desig process I followed while
      implementing this component consisted of two phases,
      <strong>discovery</strong> and <strong>design</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Breadcrumb Component Task</h2>
    <p>
      The component I was tasked with to design was a breadcrumb component.The
      breadcrumb is a <strong>compact navigation system</strong> used to show a
      user’s location within the site’s hierarchy.
    </p>
    <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
    <p>
      During the discovery phase I explored the best practices for the component
      including its funciotnality and accessibility. I explored Nielson Norman
      Group and Designing for web accessibility W3 to note down the best
      practices. I used a <a href="">Figma file</a> to store my design process
      during the discovery phase.

      I visited other design systems to see how they approach the breadcrumb
      component. The design systems I approached were <a href="">Atlassian</a>,
      <a href="">Ant</a> and <a href="">Carbon</a>. I made note of all the
      <strong>common patterns</strong> these design systems use for their
      breadcrumb component. Keeping the developers in mind, I took note of the
      props each design system used in their breadcrumb component because after
      completing my design for the breadcrumb, I need to provide
      <strong>developer specifications</strong> to the Atlas developers.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Phase</h2>
    <p>
      After a few hard working hours in Figma I successfully created the
      breadcrumb component. With all of the research I gathered, I combined them
      into one final design solution. The component consists of a maximum of
      eight breadcrumb items that are <strong>separated</strong> using the ">"
      symbol. Each breadcrumb item is a link except the current page breadcrumb.
    </p>

    <p>
      To implement this component, I reused the Atlas
      <strong>link component</strong> and added it to the breadcrumb component
      along with the separators. Re-using the link component and adding it to be
      a piece of the breadcrumb component reminded of a great quote said by Drew
      Bridewell:
    </p>
    <div class="blockquote">
      <p>
        “A design system acts as the connective tissue that holds together your
        entire platform.” - Drew Bridewell, Invision
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Designing the component in the Travelport's Figma file create what is
      known as a <strong>single source of truth</strong>. This means that when
      other designer want to use the breadcrumb component in their own
      wireframes they can do so without "breaking" the component. Atlas has
      control over the source of truth breadcrumb component and, therefore, if
      any design changes need to be made for the component, an Atlas designer
      like me can come in and edit the source of truth component. The breadcrumb
      component the other designers use which is can be seen as the "child" of
      the source of truth component (parent), will <strong>inherit</strong> any
      changes made to its parent. This does not cause any interuption to the
      designers using the component, it simply updates.

      On the Atlas documentation site, I wrote the full documentation for the
      breadcrumb component and it can be viewed
      <a
        href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
        >here</a
      >. In this documentation I highlight the overview of the component, some
      do's and dont's, and a list of the usage guidelines.
